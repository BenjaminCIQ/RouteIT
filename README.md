# **RouteIT Payment Instructions**

RouteIT Trial version runs for 20 minutes per activity before prompting payment. Restarting activity resets trial period. A trial banner is also displayed at the beginning of an activity. Otherwise, the trial version has the full functionality of RouteIT, with route navigation and customizable data fields.
To unlock RouteIT for unlimited use, a **€2.50** payment is required, after which I will send you an unlock code. Instructions for the payment process is as follows:

**1. Set RouteIT as your Active Datafield**
> RouteIT needs to be set as an active datafield to generate a legitimate User ID. The image below shows the steps to follow to set RouteIT as your active datafield. This is shown on a touch-screen device, specifically a Vivoactive 4, but the procedure will be similar for all devices.

**2. Finding Your Unique User ID**
> To generate an unlock code that only works for RouteIT on your device, you need to send me your unique User ID for RouteIT. If someone else tries to use this unlock code on their watch, the unlock code will not match their user ID.

> **Your User ID is a random generation of numbers and letters, it does not provide me with any user information. The only purpose of this User ID is to generate your unique unlock code that will only work for your device. The user ID and unlock code are never sent over the internet during app use, they are stored and used on the device only.**

> Once RouteIT has been added as an active data field and initialised at least once, this Unique User ID will appear in your settings file as shown here:

**3. Payment**
> Once you have found your User ID, a **€2.50** payment can be made to [paypal.me/BenjaminHpay](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/BenjaminHpay/2.50eur). You need to add your USER ID as a note for the payment. Make sure that the email address you want the user code sent to is in your paypal contact info. Otherwise, add your desired email address into the note as well.

> The code generation is a manual process and I will contact you within 24 hours with your user code to unlock RouteIT.

**4. Entering your User Code to Unlock RouteIT**

> Once you receive the User Code via email, it can be copied into the settings file under "User code".

> A correctly entered user code will cause the "Trial Version" banner at app start to disappear. 

## **Important Information to Note**
> * You user code will remain in place across updated versions. When RouteIT is deleted and re-installed, the stored settings are also deleted and so the code will disappear. However, the same code will work to re-unlock the app, so please keep the code stored safely somewhere other than in the settings file.

> * Unfortunately the code is for a single device only. A different device will require a new purchase of an user code. This includes if you upgrade to a new device.
